challenge: Understanding the dose–response relationship of therapeutic compounds is a major focus of clinical oncology. Large-scale drug screening in cancer cell lines has demonstrated that different genomic characteristics (mutations) confer distinct drug sensitivity, supporting patient stratification into treatment regimens on the basis of genomic markers. As cell viability assays become widely used, it is important to provide easily accessible tools to analyze drug profiling data.

shortDescription: I extended the functionality of the R-based software 'drexplorer' to create 'drexplore2,' a comprehensive tool for dose-response analysis. This extension includes features for assessing experiment reproducibility, outlier detection, fitting various models, model selection, IC value estimation, and evaluating drug interactions. Several of my publications have greatly benefited from the use of this package.
solution: This versatile R package covers various aspects of dose-response and drug-drug interaction analysis. Its user-friendly GUI allows biologists without programming skills to analyze their data effectively.
