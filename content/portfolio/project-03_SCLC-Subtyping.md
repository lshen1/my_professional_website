challenge: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is currently treated as a single entity despite its molecular and clinical heterogeneity, leading to predictably poor outcomes. There is an urgent need to define SCLC subtypes to advance precision medicine.

shortDescription: Using tumor expression data and non-negative matrix factorization, we identify four SCLC subtypes defined largely by differential expression of transcription factors ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 or low expression of all three transcription factor signatures accompanied by an Inflamed gene signature (SCLC-A, N, P and I, respectively).
solution: This application allows users to analyze their data and replicate the classification of Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) into four distinct subtypes (SCLC-A/N/P/I) as published in Cancer Cell by Gay et al (2021).
