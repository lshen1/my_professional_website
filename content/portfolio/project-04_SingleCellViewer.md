challenge: As the generation of complex single-cell RNA sequencing datasets becomes more commonplace it is the responsibility of researchers to provide access to these data in a way that can be easily explored and shared. Whilst it is often the case that data is deposited for future bioinformatic analysis many studies do not release their data in a way that is easy to explore by non-computational researchers.

project: '[View ShinyApp](https://lshen1.shinyapps.io/SingleCell_panc8/)'
shortDescription: I built upon the foundation of the R package ShinyCell to transform single-cell RNA sequencing datasets into interactive and shareable interfaces. I customized its functionality, layout, and theme to enhance usability and user experience.
solution: This application allows users to create interactive Shiny-based web application to visualize single-cell data.
