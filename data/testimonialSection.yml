    comment: "Li diligently developed multiple analysis pipelines for the single cell data in preprocessing with cellranger and analysis with the Seurat package. Furthermore, his creation of a visualization app with ShinyCell, where he was the first analyst to introduce this approach, among others, has enabled us to query the datasets efficiently, allowing us to make fast progress in hypothesis-generating and -confirming aspects of the work. This was particularly impressive given that our project marked his very first encounter with single cell data. Since providing the ShinyCell app, he has further enhanced the original app to support multiple apps within one interface and created a one-of-a-kind app with a customized theme that aligns with MD Anderson's goal of groundbreaking research. We could not have conducted our cancer immunotherapy studies without his expert help."
